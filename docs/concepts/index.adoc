== Concepts

This section explains the fundamental concepts behind Cabriolet and the file formats it supports.

=== Topics

==== xref:compression-algorithms.adoc[Compression Algorithms]

Understanding how data compression works:

* LZSS sliding window compression
* MSZIP/DEFLATE mechanics
* LZX advanced features
* Quantum arithmetic coding
* Huffman encoding fundamentals

==== xref:cabinet-structure.adoc[Cabinet Structure]

Anatomy of Microsoft Cabinet files:

* CFHEADER, CFFOLDER, CFFILE structures
* Data blocks and compression
* Multi-part cabinet relationships
* Reserve data and extensions

==== xref:folders-and-files.adoc[Folders and Files]

How CAB files organize content:

* The folder concept in CAB archives
* File ordering and relationships
* Compression boundaries
* Folder-based compression strategies

==== xref:bitstreams.adoc[Bitstream Processing]

Low-level bit manipulation:

* Bit-level reading and writing
* Endianness handling
* Buffer management
* Bit ordering considerations

==== xref:huffman-coding.adoc[Huffman Coding]

Statistical compression techniques:

* Huffman tree construction
* Code length tables
* Tree building algorithms
* Fast decoding tables

==== xref:io-abstraction.adoc[I/O Abstraction]

Platform-independent I/O:

* Handle abstraction layer
* File and memory handles
* Custom I/O implementations
* Performance considerations

=== Purpose

These concept documents provide deeper understanding of:

* **How things work** - Internal mechanisms and algorithms
* **Why they work** - Theoretical foundations
* **Design decisions** - Trade-offs and rationale
* **Relationships** - How components interact

=== Prerequisites

Basic understanding of:

* Binary data and hexadecimal notation
* File I/O operations
* Data structures (arrays, trees)
* Basic information theory (optional but helpful)
