=== Compression Algorithms

Five compression algorithms supported:

* **None** - Uncompressed storage
* **LZSS** - Simple dictionary compression
* **MSZIP** - Deflate-based compression (ZIP-compatible)
* **LZX** - High compression ratio
* **Quantum** - Memory-efficient compression

=== Key Features

* **Pure Ruby** - No native dependencies, works on any Ruby platform
* **Format Detection** - Automatic format identification
* **Multi-part Support** - Handle split CAB archives
* **Embedded CABs** - Extract cabinets from executables
* **Salvage Mode** - Recover data from damaged archives
* **Custom I/O** - File or memory-based operations
* **CLI Tools** - Complete command-line interface
* **Ruby API** - Full programmatic access

=== Example Usage

.Extracting a CAB file
[source,ruby]
----
require 'cabriolet'

# Extract all files
Cabriolet::CAB::Decompressor.new('archive.cab').extract('output/')

# List contents
Cabriolet::CAB::Decompressor.new('archive.cab').each_file do |file|
  puts "#{file.name} (#{file.size} bytes)"
end
----

.Command-line interface

For extraction and listing, formats are auto-detected from the file. For creation,
the format is determined by the output file extension or `--format` option:

[source,bash]
----
# Extract/list - auto-detects format from input file
cabriolet extract archive.cab output/
cabriolet list help.chm

# Create - format determined by output extension
cabriolet create archive.cab file1.txt file2.txt
cabriolet create help.chm index.html style.css
cabriolet create compressed.ex_ program.exe    # SZDD format

# Create with explicit format (overrides extension)
cabriolet create --format szdd output.tx_ input.txt
cabriolet create --format chm output.chm *.html

# Test archive integrity
cabriolet test archive.cab

# Force format for extraction (rarely needed)
cabriolet extract --format szdd file.dat output.txt
