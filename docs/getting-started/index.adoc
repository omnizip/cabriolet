=== Concepts

Cabriolet provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a Ruby API for working with Microsoft compression formats. The getting started guides focus on the CLI for simplicity, but each operation has an equivalent API method documented in the <<../reference/api/index#,API Reference>>.

=== Quick Navigation

==== 1. Installation

<<installation#,Install Cabriolet>> using RubyGems. Takes less than a minute.

==== 2. Quick Start

<<quick-start#,Extract your first CAB file>> in 5 minutes with step-by-step instructions.

==== 3. Your First CAB

<<your-first-cab#,Create a CAB archive>> from your own files.

=== Next Steps

After completing the getting started guides:

* Explore <<../guides/formats/index#,Format-Specific Guides>> for the format you need
* Learn about <<../guides/compression/index#,Compression Algorithms>> to choose the right one
* Review the <<../reference/cli/index#,CLI Reference>> for all available commands
