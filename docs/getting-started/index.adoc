== Getting started

=== Purpose

This section helps you get Cabriolet installed and working within minutes. Follow the guides in order to go from installation to creating your first CAB archive.

=== Concepts

Cabriolet provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a Ruby API for working with Microsoft compression formats. The getting started guides focus on the CLI for simplicity, but each operation has an equivalent API method documented in the <<../reference/api/index,API Reference>>.

=== Quick Navigation

==== 1. Installation

<<installation,Install Cabriolet>> using RubyGems. Takes less than a minute.

<<quick-start,Extract CAB files>> in 5 minutes with step-by-step instructions.

==== 3. Your First CAB

* Explore <<../guides/formats/index,Format Guides>> for the format you need
* Learn about <<../guides/compression/index,compression algorithms>> to choose the right one
* Review the <<../reference/cli/index,CLI Reference>> for all available commands
