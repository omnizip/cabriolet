== Installation

=== Purpose

This guide covers installing Cabriolet on your system. Cabriolet is a pure Ruby gem with no native dependencies, making installation straightforward on any platform that supports Ruby.

=== References

* https://rubygems.org/gems/cabriolet[Cabriolet on RubyGems]
* https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Installing Ruby]

=== Concepts

Cabriolet is distributed as a Ruby gem through RubyGems.org. It requires Ruby 2.7 or later and has no native dependencies, ensuring compatibility across platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

=== Requirements

==== Ruby Version

Cabriolet requires Ruby 2.7 or later. Check your Ruby version:

[source,bash]
----
ruby --version
----

If you need to install or update Ruby, see the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[official Ruby installation guide].

==== Operating System Support

Cabriolet works on all platforms that support Ruby:

* Linux (all distributions)
* macOS (10.14+)
* Windows (10+)
* BSD systems
* Any other Ruby-compatible platform

=== Installation Methods

==== Method 1: Installing from RubyGems (Recommended)

Install the latest stable version:

[source,bash]
----
gem install cabriolet
----

This installs both the library and command-line tools.

==== Method 2: Installing from Source

For development or to use unreleased features:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/omnizip/cabriolet.git
cd cabriolet
bundle install
bundle exec rake install
----

==== Method 3: Using Bundler in Your Project

Add to your `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'cabriolet'
----

Then install:

[source,bash]
----
bundle install
----

=== Verifying Installation

After installation, verify Cabriolet is available:

[source,bash]
----
cabriolet --version
----

You should see output like:

[source,text]
----
Cabriolet version 0.1.0
----

Test basic functionality:

[source,bash]
----
cabriolet --help
----

This displays the available commands.

=== Troubleshooting

==== Command Not Found

If `cabriolet` is not found after installation:

1. Ensure the gem binaries directory is in your PATH:
+
[source,bash]
----
gem environment
----
+
Look for the "EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY" path.

2. Add it to your PATH if needed (typically `~/.gem/ruby/X.X.X/bin`):
+
[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$PATH:$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')/bin"
----

==== Permission Errors

If you get permission errors during installation:

1. Use the `--user-install` flag:
+
[source,bash]
----
gem install cabriolet --user-install
----

2. Or use a Ruby version manager like rbenv or RVM instead of the system Ruby.

==== Version Conflicts

If you encounter dependency conflicts:

[source,bash]
----
gem update --system
gem install cabriolet
----

=== Next steps
