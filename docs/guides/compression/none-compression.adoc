== None (Uncompressed) Storage

=== Purpose

This guide explains uncompressed storage in Cabriolet - when and why to use no compression.

=== References

* <<choosing-algorithm#,Choosing a Compression Algorithm>>
* <<../formats/cab-format#compression-support,CAB Format - Compression>>

=== Concepts

==== What is Uncompressed Storage?

Uncompressed storage means files are stored exactly as-is, with no compression applied. This is useful when:

* Files are already compressed (JPEG, PNG, MP3, ZIP)
* Speed is critical
* Files are very small
* Testing or debugging

==== When to Use None

Use uncompressed storage for:

* **Already-compressed files** - JPG, PNG, GIF, MP3, MP4, ZIP, GZ
* **Very small files** - <1 KB (compression overhead too high)
* **Speed-critical** - Real-time operations
* **Testing** - Debugging compression issues
* **Encrypted files** - DRM or encrypted content

=== Usage

==== CAB Files

[source,ruby]
----
compressor = Cabriolet::CAB::Compressor.new(compression: :none)
compressor.add_file('image.jpg')
compressor.add_file('video.mp4')
compressor.write('media.cab')
----

==== CHM Files

[source,ruby]
----
compressor = Cabriolet::CHM::Compressor.new
# Images go to uncompressed section
compressor.add_file('logo.png', '/logo.png', section: :uncompressed)
compressor.generate('help.chm')
----

==== Command Line

[source,bash]
----
# CAB with no compression
cabriolet create --compression=none media.cab *.jpg

# KWAJ with no compression
cabriolet kwaj-compress --compression=none data.bin data.kwj

=== Best Practices

1. **Use for pre-compressed files** - Never compress JPG, PNG, MP3, etc.
2. **Test first** - Verify compression doesn't help before using none
3. **Consider hybrid** - Mix compressed text with uncompressed media
4. **Document choice** - Note why files are uncompressed
