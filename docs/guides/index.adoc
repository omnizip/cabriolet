== Guides

=== Purpose

This section provides comprehensive guides for using Cabriolet effectively. From basic operations to advanced techniques, these guides cover all aspects of working with Microsoft compression formats.

=== References

* <<../getting-started/index,Getting Started Guide>>
* <<../reference/cli/index,CLI Reference>>

=== Concepts

Cabriolet supports multiple compression formats and algorithms, each with specific use cases. These guides help you understand when and how to use each format, choose appropriate compression algorithms, and handle advanced scenarios.

=== Guide Categories

==== Basic Usage

<<basic-usage/index,Basic Usage Guides>> cover fundamental operations:

* Extracting files from archives
* Creating new archives
* Listing archive contents
* Testing archive integrity

==== Format Guides

<<formats/index,Format Guides>> document each of the 7 supported formats:

* link:../formats/cab-format[Microsoft Cabinet files]
* link:../formats/chm-format[Compiled HTML Help]
* link:../formats/szdd-format[Single-file LZSS compression]
* link:../formats/kwaj-format[KWAJ compression format]
* link:../formats/hlp-format[Windows Help files]
* link:../formats/lit-format[Microsoft Reader eBooks]
* link:../formats/oab-format[Offline Address Book]

==== Compression Algorithms

<<compression/index,Compression Algorithm Guides>> explain the 5 supported algorithms:

* link:../compression/choosing-algorithm[Selection guide]
* link:../compression/none-compression[Uncompressed storage]
* link:../compression/lzss-compression[Dictionary compression]
* link:../compression/mszip-compression[ZIP/Deflate compatible]
* link:../compression/lzx-compression[High compression ratio]
* link:../compression/quantum-compression[Memory-efficient]

==== Advanced Usage

<<advanced-usage/index,Advanced Usage Guides>> cover specialized topics:

* link:../advanced-usage/multi-part-cabinets[Split archives]
* link:../../examples/extract-installer[Extracting from executables]
* link:../advanced-usage/memory-operations[Memory and streaming]
* link:../advanced-usage/error-handling[Robust error management]
* link:../advanced-usage/salvage-mode[Recovering damaged archives]
* link:../advanced-usage/performance-tuning[Optimization techniques]
* link:../advanced-usage/memory-operations[In-memory processing]

=== Learning Path

Recommended progression through the guides:

1. **Start with Basics**: Master <<basic-usage/index,Basic Usage>>
2. **Learn Your Format**: Study the <<formats/index,Format Guide>> for your use case
3. **Understand Compression**: Review <<compression/index,Compression Algorithms>>
4. **Advanced Techniques**: Explore <<advanced-usage/index,Advanced Usage>> as needed
