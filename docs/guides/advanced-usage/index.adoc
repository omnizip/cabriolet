* Managing continuation cabinets

==== xref:../embedded-cabinets.adoc[Embedded Cabinets]

Finding and extracting cabinets embedded in other files:

* Searching for embedded archives
* Extracting from executables
* Handling multiple embedded cabinets
* Forensic analysis techniques

==== xref:../custom-io-handlers.adoc[Custom I/O Handlers]

Implementing custom storage backends:

* Understanding the I/O abstraction layer
* Creating custom handle types
* Network and cloud storage
* Database and encrypted file support

==== xref:../error-handling.adoc[Error Handling]

Robust error recovery and handling:

* Error class hierarchy
* Common errors and solutions
* Retry and recovery patterns
* Production-ready error handling

==== xref:../salvage-mode.adoc[Salvage Mode]

Recovering data from corrupted archives:

* When and how to use salvage mode
* Partial file recovery
* Block-level recovery techniques
* Quality assessment of recovered data

==== xref:../performance-tuning.adoc[Performance Tuning]

Optimizing compression and extraction:

* Buffer size configuration
* Algorithm selection strategies
* Parallel processing
* Benchmarking and profiling

==== xref:../memory-operations.adoc[Memory Operations]

In-memory archive processing:

* Creating and extracting without disk I/O
* Web application integration
* Memory-efficient patterns
* Archive transformation techniques

=== Prerequisites

These guides assume you're familiar with:

* Basic Cabriolet usage (see xref:../basic-usage/index.adoc[Basic Usage])
* Ruby programming fundamentals
* File format basics (see xref:../formats/index.adoc[Format Guides])
