== Basic usage

=== Purpose

This section covers fundamental operations for working with archives using Cabriolet. These guides apply to all supported formats and provide the foundation for more advanced usage.

=== References

* <<../../getting-started/index,Getting Started Guide>>
* <<../formats/index,Format Guides>>
* <<../../reference/cli/index,CLI Reference>>

=== Concepts

All archive operations in Cabriolet follow a consistent pattern, whether you're working with CAB, CHM, SZDD, or other formats. The basic operations are:

* **Extracting**: Retrieving files from an archive
* **Creating**: Building new archives from source files
* **Listing**: Viewing archive contents without extracting
* **Testing**: Verifying archive integrity

=== Basic Operations

==== Extracting files

<<extracting-files,Extracting Files>> covers:

* Extracting all files from an archive
* Specifying output directories
* Handling file conflicts
* Preserving file attributes
* Recursive extraction

==== Creating archives

<<creating-archives,Creating Archives>> explains:

* Adding files to new archives
* Choosing compression algorithms
* Setting archive options
* Adding directories recursively
* Managing file attributes

==== Listing contents

<<listing-contents,Listing Contents>> demonstrates:

* Viewing file lists
* Displaying file details
* Filtering by patterns
* Sorting output
* Formatting options

==== Testing integrity

<<testing-integrity,Testing Integrity>> covers:

* Verifying archive structure
* Checking file checksums
* Detecting corruption
* Validating compression
* Error reporting

=== Common Workflows

==== Quick extraction

[source,bash]
----
# Extract archive to current directory
cabriolet extract archive.cab

# Extract to specific directory
cabriolet extract archive.cab output/
----

==== Quick archive creation

[source,bash]
----
# Create archive from files
cabriolet create my-archive.cab file1.txt file2.txt

# Create from directory
cabriolet create backup.cab data/
----

==== Inspection workflow

[source,bash]
----
# View contents
cabriolet list archive.cab

# Get detailed info
cabriolet info archive.cab

# Test integrity
cabriolet test archive.cab
----

=== Format Compatibility

These basic operations work across all supported formats:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Format |Notes

|CAB
|Full support for all operations

|CHM
|Use `chm-` prefixed commands

|SZDD
|Single-file only, use `expand`/`compress`

|KWAJ
|Use `kwaj-` prefixed commands

|HLP
|Use `hlp-` prefixed commands

|LIT
|Use `lit-` prefixed commands

|OAB
|Use `oab-` prefixed commands
|===

For format-specific details, see <<../formats/index,Format Guides>>.
