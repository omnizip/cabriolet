== Basic Usage

=== Purpose

This section covers fundamental operations for working with archives using Cabriolet. These guides apply to all supported formats and provide the foundation for more advanced usage.

=== References

* <<../../getting-started/quick-start#,Quick Start Guide>>
* <<../formats/index#,Format-Specific Guides>>
* <<../../reference/cli/index#,CLI Reference>>

=== Concepts

All archive operations in Cabriolet follow a consistent pattern, whether you're working with CAB, CHM, SZDD, or other formats. The basic operations are:

* **Extracting**: Retrieving files from an archive
* **Creating**: Building new archives from source files
* **Listing**: Viewing archive contents without extracting
* **Testing**: Verifying archive integrity

=== Basic Operations

==== Extracting Files

<<extracting-files#,Extracting Files>> covers:

* Extracting all files from an archive
* Specifying output directories
* Handling file conflicts
* Preserving file attributes
* Recursive extraction

==== Creating Archives

<<creating-archives#,Creating Archives>> explains:

* Adding files to new archives
* Choosing compression algorithms
* Setting archive options
* Adding directories recursively
* Managing file attributes

==== Listing Contents

<<listing-contents#,Listing Archive Contents>> demonstrates:

* Viewing file lists
* Displaying file details
* Filtering by patterns
* Sorting output
* Formatting options

==== Testing Integrity

<<testing-integrity#,Testing Archive Integrity>> covers:

* Verifying archive structure
* Checking file checksums
* Detecting corruption
* Validating compression
* Error reporting

=== Common Workflows

==== Quick Extraction

[source,bash]
----
# Extract archive to current directory
cabriolet extract archive.cab

# Extract to specific directory
cabriolet extract archive.cab output/
----

==== Quick Archive Creation

[source,bash]
----
# Create archive from files
cabriolet create my-archive.cab file1.txt file2.txt

# Create from directory
cabriolet create backup.cab data/
----

==== Inspection Workflow

[source,bash]
----
# View contents
cabriolet list archive.cab

# Get detailed info
cabriolet info archive.cab

# Test integrity
cabriolet test archive.cab
----

=== Format Compatibility

These basic operations work across all supported formats:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Format |Notes

|CAB
|Full support for all operations

|CHM
|Use `chm-` prefixed commands

|SZDD
|Single-file only, use `expand`/`compress`

|KWAJ
|Use `kwaj-` prefixed commands

|HLP
|Use `hlp-` prefixed commands

|LIT
|Use `lit-` prefixed commands

|OAB
|Use `oab-` prefixed commands
|===

=== Next Steps

After mastering basic operations:

* Learn about <<../formats/index#,specific formats>> you'll be working with
* Understand <<../compression/index#,compression algorithms>> for optimal performance
* Explore <<../advanced-usage/index#,advanced techniques>> for complex scenarios
