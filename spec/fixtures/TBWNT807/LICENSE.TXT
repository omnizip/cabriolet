         1. The evaluation package of the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus
         utilities may be distributed freely without charge in
         evaluation form only.

         2. The evaluation package of the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus

         charged for its use.  If a fee is charged in connection with
         the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities at all, it should only
         cover the cost of copying or distribution. UNDER NO
         CIRCUMSTANCES should payment of such fees be understood to
         constitute legal ownership.

         3. The evaluation package of the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus
         utilities must be presented in its complete form. It is not
         allowed to distribute the program and its documentation files
         separately.

         4. Neither the software nor its documentation may be amended or
         altered in any way.

         5. By granting you the right to distribute the evaluation copy
         of the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities, you do not become the
         owner of these utilities in any form.

         6. ESaSS B.V. accepts no responsibility in case the program
         malfunctions or does not function at all.

         7. ESaSS B.V. can never be held responsible for damage,
         directly or indirectly resulting from the use of the
         Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities.

         8. Using the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities means that you
         agree to these conditions.

    Any other use, distribution or representation of the Thunderbyte
    Anti-Virus utilities is expressly forbidden without the written
    permission of ESaSS B.V.


REGISTRATION

    THIS IS NOT FREE SOFTWARE! If you paid a 'public domain' vendor for
    this program, you paid for the service of copying the program, and
    not for the program itself. Proceeds from such transactions would
    never reach the makers of this product. You may evaluate this
    product, but if you decide to make use of it, you should register
    your copy.

    To register: run the REGISTER program, and return the resulting form
    to a Thunderbyte shareware registration site.

    We offer several inducements to you for registering. First of all,
    you are entitled to support for the Thunderbyte Antivirus utilities,
    which can be quite valuable at times.


    Some very enhanced features (like the TbScan option 'extract') are
    only available to registered users. Once you have become a
    registered user, these advanced options will be made available to
    you. Your regisrations allow us to enhance our products and to keep
    them up to date!


THE REGISTRATION KEY

    Registered users receive the information and instructions to
    generate their TBAV.KEY. The key file will contain important
    information such as the licence number and the name of the licensee.
    The key file TBAV.KEY is NOT to be sold or transfered in any way.
    The Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities do search for the key file in
    the current directory. If they do not find it there, they search the
    same directory where the program file itself resides.

    If the key file is corrupt or invalid, the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus
    utilities continue without error message although your version of
    the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities will then be treated as an
    unregistered SHAREWARE version. If your key is only valid for some
    of the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus utilities, the other utilities will
    ignore it when run.

    Although you are allowed to evaluate the Thunderbyte Anti-Virus
    utilities for a reasonable period of time, it is ILLEGAL to use them
    in combination with a key, produced without authorization of ESaSS
    B.V., or generated by any software not distributed by ESaSS B.V..


DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITED WARRANTY

    ESaSS BV warrants that (a) the software will perform substantially
    in accordance with the accompanying written materials and (b) the
    software is properly recorded on the disk media. This warranty
    extends for thirty (30) days from the date of purchase. There is no
    warranty after expiration of the warranty period.

    Neither ESaSS BV nor anyone else who has been involved in the
    creation, production or delivery of the ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus
    utilities or the documentation grants any other warranties with
    respect to the contents of the software,  the written materials and
    each specifically disclaims any implied warranties of
    merchantability or fitness for any purpose.

    Except as stated herein, in no event shall ESaSS BV or its suppliers
    be liable for any damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect,
    consequential, or incidental damages (including damages for loss of
    business profits, business interruption, loss of business
    information, or other pecuniary loss), arising out of the use of or
    inability to use such product even if ESaSS BV has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages. Because some states do not allow
    the exclusion of limitation of liability for consequential or
    incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.


    ESaSS BV reserves the right to revise the software and the written
    materials and to make changes from time to time in the contents
    without obligation to notify any person.
