This is the README.TXT file for Microangelo, a product
designed specifically for working with miniature graphics
and Windows 95.

INSTALLING MICROANGELO
-----------------------
The Microangelo package includes a graphical Windows
installation program.  Copy or unzip the set of files
that accompany this README.TXT file to a floppy diskette
or into a temporary folder.  Then run the SETUP program
from the diskette or temporary folder.

UNINSTALLING MICROANGELO
------------------------
Microangelo Setup also installs an "uninstall" utility
to allow easy removal of Microangelo from your system.
Select "Add/Remove Programs" from your Settings (Control
Panel) folder and select "Microangelo 2.0" to uninstall
the software.


DISPLAYING HIGH-COLOR ICONS
---------------------------
The Microangelo Engineer component contains an option on
the System tab that is used to configure Windows 95 to
display icons using all possible colors.  Displaying icons
in more than 16 colors requires the system's video mode to
be set to GREATER than 256 colors.  Appropriate modes are
commonly referred to as High-Color (16 bit) or True Color
(24 bit).  Your system's video mode can be accessed from
the Settings tab of your Display's Property sheet.  Right
click anywhere on the desktop background and select
Properties.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Setup installs a Quickstart User Manual and displays this
manual at the conclusion of Setup.  The Quickstart guide
contains important information and tips to help get the
most out of Microangelo.

We recommend printing out the Quickstart guide and reviewing
before you use Microangelo or very soon.  It really does
contain some useful information that might be otherwise
overlooked.

Also, a thorough and concise set of online Help files
provide excellent information on program specifics and step-
by-step instructions to help you when you need it most -
while you work.  You can access online help through the
Contents window where the information is organized into
books and chapters, or go directly to the Index window to
look for specific references and keywords to help you locate
the information that you are looking for.

REGISTRATION
------------
Microangelo is not free software.  It is released as
shareware, which provides the opportunity for the program
to be evaluated before it is purchased.

We hope that when you try Microangelo you will like it so
much that you will want to register.  By doing so you are
voting with your pocketbook for us to continue developing
high-quality, Windows shareware.

Complete information on how to register Microangelo is
included in the REGISTER.DOC file.  Microangelo Setup
installs a start menu entry titled Microangelo Print
Registration Form that allows you to print the form from
your Start menu.  If you wish to remove the entry and are
not familiar with how to do so, instructions are provided
to remove the entry in the form itself.


Acknowledgements and Sincere Thanks
-----------------------------------
As most good things in this world, Microangelo is the
product of hard work, sincere effort, and contributions
of many individuals.  I would specifically like to thank
James Snyder of Shattered Rose Studio for his beta
testing efforts and the cool animated cursors he has
produced.  Four of James' creations are installed to your
Microangelo folder.  Access them from the Browser's
Animated Cursor tab.

Perhaps the most dedicated fan and contributor to
Microangelo outside of Impact Software, I want to thank
Benny Berger for sharing his suggestions, his artistic
talents, and perhaps most of all his belief that
Microangelo can be the best of its kind.  We're going
to do our best to prove you right, Benny.

Our biggest thanks go to those of you who are our
customers - who enjoy and register our software.  We
work hard to earn your support, and we thank each of
you for allowing us to provide you with great software
like Microangelo.

One last thought...  We'd like to continue to do more -
so please,  if you continue to *use it* past the agreed
evaluation period, kindly *register* this software.

Thank you!

The Impact Team
