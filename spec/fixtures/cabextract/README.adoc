== Usage

These test fixtures are used for testing and validation of the Cabriolet
implementation. They complement the libmspack fixtures with additional test
scenarios specific to cabextract.

The fixtures test various scenarios:

* Character encoding handling
* Directory structures
* Large file support
* Multi-part cabinet sets (split-*.cab)
* Embedded CAB search
* UTF-8 stress testing
* Security vulnerability test cases
